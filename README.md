# Totally-not-LinkedIn / Bootleg LinkedIn with spring

#NB! The focus of this course was not security, so it is mostly not implemented as of now.
This was project for course https://web-palvelinohjelmointi-20.mooc.fi/ (the courses projects subject is always different) and was graded as 76/80

Most aspects should works properly at the moment. 
Getting messages to posts still has n+1 problem, but as of now I don't have time to fix it.
Project has no automated tests, but I will try to impliment them in the future.
